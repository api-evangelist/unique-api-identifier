# Unique API Identifier
This is a project to attempt to define a unique identifier for APIs, providing a universal API registry, and a single way to reference public APIs available across the space.

## Format
This is the proposed format for the unique API identifier

- domain - The overall domain of the API.
- org - The organization within a domain.
- protocol - The protocol of the API (ie. http, tcp).
- resource - The resource being made available - can be general.
- version - The major version of the API being made avaolble.

## Identifiers
This is a list of actual proposed identifiers.

- salesforce_com-public-http1-50
- stripe_com-public-http1-payouts/v1
- twilio_com-public-http1-sms-2010_04_01
